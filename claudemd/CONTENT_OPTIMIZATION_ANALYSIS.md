## 2. CURRENT HOMEPAGE CONTENT

### Hero Section (H1)

to respond to the exacting demands of the industry."
```
**Issue:**

- Missing locations
- Vague "engineering needs"

### Features Section (H3 titles):
1. "Wider Choice" - About motor options
2. "Energy Efficient" - About motor quality
3. "Reliability" - About motor performance

**Issue:** All three focus on motors, pumps completely absent

### Services Section (H2)
```
"At your Service"
Subtitle: "BES is here to serve your needs in the most timely and effective manner!"
```
**Issue:** Generic, no keywords

- Homepage needs keyword integration (currently minimal)
- Add specific product type mentions
- More natural location references

### Example of Natural Integration:

**Poor (Keyword Stuffing):**
```
"We sell motors and pumps. Industrial motors, submersible pumps, water pumps,
energy-efficient motors. We have AC motors and induction motors. Motor supplier
and pump dealer in Mumbai and Ahmedabad."
```

**Good (Natural Language):**
```
"We're a leading industrial motor and submersible pump supplier, serving
customers in Mumbai and Ahmedabad with energy-efficient AC and induction motors,
