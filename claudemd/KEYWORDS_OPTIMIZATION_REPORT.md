## Why This Change?

### 1. **Google Ignores Meta Keywords (Since 2009)**
- The meta keywords tag provides **zero SEO value** to Google
- Other major search engines (Bing, Yahoo) also largely ignore it
- Excessive keywords can trigger spam filters

### 2. **Focus on What Actually Works**
Search engines now prioritize:
- ✓ **Page title** (already optimized: "Motors & Pumps Supplier in Mumbai & Ahmedabad")
- ✓ **Meta description** (well-written and natural)
- ✓ **Page content** (should naturally include your keywords)
- ✓ **Headings and structure** (H1, H2 tags)
- ✓ **Internal/external links** (topic authority)

### 3. **Avoid Keyword Stuffing Penalties**
- Excessive repetitive keywords look unnatural
- Modern algorithms detect and penalize this
- Your new keyword list appears professional and intentional
