Different Virtualmin versions have different field names. Look for:
- "CA Certificate"

If you still can't find it, look for an "Upload" button or option to paste certificate content.

================================================================================
CERTIFICATE CONTENT TO PASTE
================================================================================

Open the file: CERTIFICATE_CHAIN_TO_INSTALL.txt
And copy the text between these markers:

---BEGIN COPY HERE---
[3 certificates will be here]
---END COPY HERE---

Copy everything INCLUDING the "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----" and "-----END CERTIFICATE-----" lines.

================================================================================
VERIFICATION COMMANDS (after installation)
================================================================================

If you have SSH access, verify the installation:

openssl s_client -connect www.bombayengg.net:443 -servername www.bombayengg.net 2>&1 | grep "depth="

You should see:
  depth=2 ...
  depth=1 ...
  depth=0 ...

If you see all 3 lines, the installation was successful!

================================================================================
TESTING WITH EXTERNAL SERVICES
================================================================================

After installation, test that external services can validate your certificate:

1. SSL Checker:
   https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html

   Should show: "Certificate OK" with all green checkmarks

2. Your LLM file:
   https://www.bombayengg.net/llms.txt
   Should load without SSL certificate errors

================================================================================
